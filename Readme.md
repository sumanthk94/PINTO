# Detailed Documentation
## PdeModel class:
__Attributes__

 - model: PINTO/DeepONet model object (built using Tensorflow Functional API)
 - optimizer: optimizer object
 - loss_fn: loss function object
 - parameters: Governing equations parameters (Re, nue, beta, etc.)
 - inner/bound/init_data: Tensorflow dataset object
 - batches
 - loss_tracker: metrics to track the various loss terms during training
 - Methods
    - __init__: constructor to initialize the attributes
    - create_data_pipeline: to create the TensorFlow dataset for training/validation
    - Pde_residual: to compute the PDE residuals of corresponding numerical examples using Automatic Differentiation
    - train_step: to perform a single training step (which essentially consists of four major steps)
        - Forward pass
        - Compute loss
        - Backward pass (computing gradients using backpropagation)
        - Update weights (applying gradients to the model weights using the optimizer)
    - test_step: to perform a single test step (which essentially consists of two major steps)
        - Forward pass
        - Compute loss
    -reset_metrics: to reset the loss metrics at the beginning of each epoch
    -get_model_graph: to get the PINTO/DeepONet model plot
    -run: performs the training of the model for a provided number of epochs
    -prediction: to perform the prediction of the model for given input coordinates
    -get_plots: to get the plots of the model predictions at regular intervals (plot_freq in run method defines the interval to plot)
 ## utils.py
  ![Data generation](Data_generation.png)
### Data generation:
1. Collocation points are generated using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method
2. Boundary/initial points to impose boundary/initial conditions (either on grid points or randomly chosen points with the initial/boundary condition, 
__only for boundary and initial conditions simulation data file is used__)
3. boundary vector sequence points for BPE and BVE units are chosen randomly on all sides of the boundary 
4. For each collocation and initial/boundary point, the same boundary vector sequence is used as input to BPE and BVE units.
5. The above image shows data generation on the 2D domain (X-Y).

- The utils file has been updated with detailed documentation in generating and creating the dataset to train the model.
- contains the functions to create the input coordinates for QPE, BPE, and BVE units.
- contains the functions to create the initial/boundary conditions for QPE, BPE, and BVE units.
## model.py
  - it is a config file to build and run the model with the  following attributes:
    - model_type: PINTO/DeepONet using Tensorflow Functional API
    - data_dir: path to the dataset
    - batch_size: batch size for training
    - epochs: number of epochs for training
    - plot_freq: frequency of plotting the model predictions during training
    - learning_rate: learning rate for the optimizer
    - optimizer: optimizer type (Adam, AdamW, etc.)
    - loss_fn: loss function type (MSE)
    - lr_Schedule: learning rate schedule type (ExponentialDecay, PolynomialDecay, etc.)
    - PdeModel: PdeModel class object
    - wandb: wandb object for logging the training process (True/False)
    - metrics: metrics to track the training process (MAE)
